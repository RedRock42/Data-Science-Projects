# MS Data Analytics Project - Utah Census Prediction Analysis 

This folder contains the files for the Utah Census Analysis 

Goal of Project: For this project, I used two programming languages, Python and R. Python was used to scrape the web links from the HTML code of the “U.S. Census Bureau’s Population Estimates” web page. R was then used to conduct a linear regression analysis on the scraped population data to predict the size of the population of Utah state in 2020.

Part 2_R - File contains the R code used in the linear regession analysis and cleaned data input file
