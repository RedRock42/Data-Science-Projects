# Which Car Should I Choose? A Data Vizualization Project

### *MS Data Analytics Project*

This folder contains the files for the Which Car Should I Choose? A Data Vizualization Project project. 


#### Goal of Project

You have been hired as a data analyst and one of your first tasks includes selecting a car, primarily for your use, that will become part of the company fleet. Your manager has already narrowed down the choices to four vehicles: a 2017 Ford Escape, 2017 Honda CRV, 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe, or 2017 Toyota Rav 4. Because you will purchase the car with company funds, your manager has asked you to select a vehicle based on the companyâ€™s criteria; however, your own criteria for choosing a car are different. You must use data visualization best practices to create a dashboard, using data you will scrape, and tell a story for your manager to support your car selection.
